notes:
  - "Timing varies with meal size, meal composition (fat/fiber slow emptying), sleep, stress, and activity."
  - "These are general physiology trends, not medical advice. If you have diabetes, are pregnant, have a history of eating disorders, or take glucose/BP meds, fasting should be clinician-guided."
  - "Hunger often comes in waves—especially when the gut ‘cleaning cycle’ (MMC) runs—so a hunger spike doesn’t always mean you’re low on energy."
hours:
  - hour: 1
    emoji: "🍽️"
    label: "Digesting"
    actions:
      - "Your nervous system leans ‘rest-and-digest’ (parasympathetic): saliva, stomach acid, and enzymes ramp up to break food into usable parts."
      - "The stomach churns food mechanically while acid and pepsin start protein breakdown; this turns the meal into a semi-liquid mixture for the small intestine."
      - "The pancreas prepares digestive enzymes (for carbs, fats, proteins) and the gallbladder releases bile to help emulsify fats so they can be absorbed later."
      - "Satiety signals (like stretch in the stomach and gut hormones) start rising—this is part of why you feel calmer or sleepy after a large meal."

  - hour: 2
    emoji: "🍬"
    label: "Nutrient uptake"
    actions:
      - "Most absorption happens in the small intestine: sugars become glucose, proteins become amino acids, and fats are packaged for transport."
      - "Insulin rises to move glucose into cells and rebuild glycogen (stored carbohydrate) in liver and muscle—especially if you were active recently."
      - "Amino acids support repair and muscle protein building; dietary fats are absorbed more slowly and can keep digestion going longer."
      - "You may feel a ‘fed’ energy bump now—because blood nutrients are plentiful and storage pathways are active."

  - hour: 4
    emoji: "🧹"
    label: "Cleanup mode"
    actions:
      - "You’re moving into the post-absorptive phase: insulin trends down and the body shifts from ‘store’ signals toward ‘use what’s available.’"
      - "Gastric emptying is often mostly done by now (but can be slower after a high-fat/high-fiber meal), so the stomach is less busy."
      - "The migrating motor complex (MMC) can restart—rhythmic ‘sweeping’ contractions that move leftovers and microbes along between meals."
      - "Those stomach growls or sudden hunger spikes can be MMC activity, not an emergency fuel shortage; frequent snacking can interrupt this cycle."

  - hour: 8
    emoji: "🔥"
    label: "Fat release"
    actions:
      - "Lower insulin allows more lipolysis: fat cells release fatty acids into the bloodstream for energy."
      - "The liver helps stabilize blood sugar by releasing some glycogen (stored glucose), especially overnight or between meals."
      - "Muscle increasingly uses fatty acids at rest; light movement (walking) nudges the body to burn more fat without needing a ‘hard workout.’"
      - "If you’re under stress or slept poorly, hunger may feel stronger—even though fat release is still happening—because stress hormones affect appetite."

  - hour: 12
    emoji: "⚡"
    label: "Fat oxidation"
    actions:
      - "As liver glycogen declines, the body leans harder on beta-oxidation (burning fatty acids) to power organs and muscles."
      - "The liver may start producing measurable ketones for some people (timing varies widely); ketones are an alternative fuel, especially for the brain."
      - "Protein is not the main fuel here, but some gluconeogenesis (making glucose from non-carb sources) continues to supply glucose-dependent tissues."
      - "Many notice steadier energy because the body is less dependent on rapid glucose swings and more on slow, continuous fuel release."

  - hour: 14
    emoji: "🌤️"
    label: "Stable energy"
    actions:
      - "With insulin low and fuel coming steadily from fat, energy can feel more even—fewer cravings triggered by rapid blood-sugar changes."
      - "Hunger often shows up as predictable waves (ghrelin rhythms); if you wait them out, they frequently fade."
      - "Hydration and electrolytes matter more now—fat metabolism and lower insulin can increase sodium loss, which can feel like fatigue or headache."

  - hour: 16
    emoji: "🌙"
    label: "Deep fat fuel"
    actions:
      - "Liver glycogen is typically lower, so fat-based fueling becomes more dominant and ketone output often increases (again: variable by person)."
      - "This is a common ‘second wind’ window: some people feel clearer or more driven due to adrenaline/norepinephrine changes that support alertness."
      - "Cellular ‘cleanup/recycling’ signaling may increase during longer fasts, but the exact timing and magnitude in humans varies—avoid overpromising here."
      - "If you feel weak or dizzy, it’s often fluid/salt-related rather than ‘running out of fuel’—your body has plenty of stored energy."

  - hour: 18
    emoji: "🧠"
    label: "Steady focus"
    actions:
      - "Many people report smoother focus as ketones contribute more to brain energy and appetite hormones become less noisy between waves."
      - "Reduced snacking cues can happen because insulin stays low and you’re not repeatedly re-triggering the fed-state cycle."
      - "A good learning cue here: notice whether cravings are ‘habit cravings’ (time/place-triggered) vs true hunger (persistent + physical)."

  - hour: 20
    emoji: "🧘"
    label: "Discipline window"
    actions:
      - "This window often tests routine more than physiology—hunger waves can be strong, but they typically crest and pass."
      - "It helps to plan your refeed ahead of time: deciding in advance reduces impulsive choices when you’re hungry."
      - "If you’re going to break the fast soon, aim for a calm re-entry rather than a huge ‘reward’ meal that can cause stomach discomfort."

  - hour: 24
    emoji: "💧"
    label: "Hydration focus"
    actions:
      - "Longer fasts increase the importance of electrolytes (especially sodium; also potassium/magnesium depending on diet and sweating)."
      - "Common signals you’re under-salted or under-hydrated: headache, dizziness on standing, fatigue, irritability."
      - "A gentle refeed is smart: start smaller, chew well, and give your gut 20–30 minutes before deciding you need more."
      - "If you have medical conditions or take meds that affect blood sugar or blood pressure, this duration can be higher risk without guidance."

  - hour: 36
    emoji: "🥣"
    label: "Gentle refeed"
    actions:
      - "After longer fasts, digestion may feel ‘sensitive’—not because digestion stops, but because large meals can overwhelm a calmer GI pace."
      - "Break the fast with easy-to-digest foods (broth/soup, yogurt, eggs, cooked vegetables) and smaller portions first."
      - "Avoid a huge high-fat/high-sugar meal right away; it can cause GI upset and a big glucose/insulin swing."
      - "If you’re doing 36+ hour fasts regularly, consider clinician input—especially if you’re lean, very active, or prone to lightheadedness."
